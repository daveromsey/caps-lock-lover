## Acknowledgements ##
This script is mostly assembled from modified versions of the following awesome scripts:

### [Caps Lock Remap by Danik](https://gist.github.com/Danik/5808330/raw/d572399237ee5f1ccb3a50ba7ae3ebdc0df71883/capslock_remap_alt.ahk) More info [here](http://danikgames.com/blog/?p=714). ###

Changes:

- Customized the shortcuts formatting to fit my personal preferences.

### [Home Row Computing by Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/home-row-computing/) ###

Changes:

- Does not need register remapping of AppsKey using SharpKeys.
- Uses normal cursor key layout 
- Added more hotkeys for insert, undo, redo etc.

### [Linux Alt + Window Drag Functionality in Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/get-the-linux-altwindow-drag-functionality-in-windows/) ###

Changes: The only change was using Caps Lock instead of Alt. This also removes problems in certain applications.
